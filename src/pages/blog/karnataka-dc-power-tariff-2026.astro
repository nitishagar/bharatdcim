  <p>
    Karnataka, home to India's tech capital Bengaluru, is the <strong>clear cost leader</strong> for data
    center power in February 2026. KERC's simplified flat-rate structure, lowest demand charges, and
    symmetrical ToD model make it the most attractive state for power-sensitive deployments.

    <strong>Cost Leader:</strong> At an effective rate of ~₹8.50/kWh (all-in for 24x7 operations),
    Karnataka is ₹2-3/unit cheaper than Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. For a 200-rack facility, this
    translates to ₹20-30 lakhs/month in savings.
  </div>

  <h2>Time-of-Day (ToD) Tariff Structure</h2>

  <p>
    Karnataka employs a <strong>symmetrical ±₹1.00 absolute adder model</strong> — the simplest and
    most predictable ToD structure among major DC states.
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Time Slot</th>
        <th>Hours</th>
        <th>Adjustment</th>
        <th>Effective Rate</th>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Morning Normal</td>
        <td>06:00 - 10:00</td>
        <td>Base Rate</td>
        <td>₹6.60/kWh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Day Normal</td>
        <td>10:00 - 18:00</td>
        <td>Base Rate</td>
        <td>₹6.60/kWh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Evening Peak</strong></td>
        <td>18:00 - 22:00</td>
        <td><strong>+₹1.00/kWh</strong></td>
        <td><strong>₹7.60/kWh</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Night Off-Peak</strong></td>
        <td>22:00 - 06:00</td>
        <td><strong>-₹1.00/kWh</strong></td>
        <td><strong>₹5.60/kWh</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>ToD-Neutral for 24x7:</strong> The symmetry (±₹1.00) with equal 4-hour peak (18-22) and
    8-hour off-peak (22-06) means data centers with a flat load profile are <em>net beneficiaries</em>
    of the ToD structure — the night rebate hours are double the peak surcharge hours.
  </div>

  <h2>Key Advantage: No Morning Peak</h2>

  <p>
    Unlike Maharashtra (morning peak 09-12), Tamil Nadu (morning peak 06-10), and Telangana
    (morning peak 06-10), Karnataka has <strong>no morning peak surcharge</strong>. The entire 06:00-18:00
    window is at base rate. This is a significant advantage for data centers that see morning demand
    spikes from business hours.
  </p>

  <h2>Open Access Risk: Additional Surcharge Petition</h2>

  <div class="warning-box">
    <strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> BESCOM has filed a petition for an Additional Surcharge of
    <strong>₹1.65/unit</strong> to recover stranded PPA costs from industries switching to Open Access.
    Hearings are ongoing in Feb 2026. If approved, this would virtually eliminate the OA arbitrage,
    forcing industries back to BESCOM supply.
  </div>

  <h2>Cost Comparison: Why Karnataka Wins</h2>

    For a standard 1,000 kVA facility consuming 300 MWh/month (3-shift continuous operation, Feb 2026):

  <p>
    <em>Karnataka saves ₹6-8 lakhs/month vs other states for the same facility profile.</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Simplified Billing: Flat Rate</h2>

  <p>
    KERC has abolished the previous slab system. A single flat rate of ₹6.60/kWh applies to all
    consumption levels. This simplifies billing and rewards scale — large consumers don't face
    higher marginal rates.
  </p>

  <h2>Power Factor Advantage</h2>

  <p>
    Karnataka's 0.85 PF threshold (vs 0.90 in other states) provides more flexibility:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lower APFC panel requirements</li>
    <li>More tolerance for variable IT loads</li>
    <li>Reduced penalty exposure during UPS operations</li>
    <li>kWh billing means PF doesn't inflate billed units (unlike MH/TS kVAh billing)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bengaluru Market Dynamics</h2>

  <p>
    While tariffs are attractive, Bengaluru-specific considerations include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Land scarcity:</strong> Premium locations in Whitefield and Electronic City command high prices</li>
    <li><strong>Water availability:</strong> Bengaluru's water crisis affects cooling infrastructure planning</li>
    <li><strong>Grid reliability:</strong> Some industrial areas need robust backup planning</li>
    <li><strong>Fiber connectivity:</strong> Strong domestic connectivity, growing international routes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Renewable Energy Options</h2>

  <p>
    Karnataka is India's solar deployment leader:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open access solar:</strong> Competitive wheeling charges (but watch the Additional Surcharge risk)</li>
    <li><strong>Captive solar:</strong> Land available in peripheral areas at reasonable rates</li>
    <li><strong>Wind power:</strong> Group captive arrangements available</li>
  </ul>
