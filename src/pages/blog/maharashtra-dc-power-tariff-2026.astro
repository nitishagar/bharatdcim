  <p>
    Maharashtra is India's largest data center market, with Mumbai alone hosting over 40% of the country's
    installed capacity. Understanding MERC (Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission) tariffs is
    essential for any colocation operator or enterprise running facilities in the state.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick Reference: Maharashtra HT Industrial Tariff</h2>

  <table>

  <h2>Time-of-Day (ToD) Tariff Structure</h2>

  <p>
    Maharashtra's ToD structure is relatively straightforward compared to other states, with a single
    peak window in the evening hours.
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Time Slot</th>
        <th>Hours</th>
        <th>Adjustment</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Off-Peak (Night)</td>
        <td>00:00 - 06:00</td>
        <td>Base Rate</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Normal</td>
        <td>06:00 - 09:00</td>
        <td>Base Rate</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Solar Hours</td>
        <td>09:00 - 17:00</td>
        <td><strong>-15% Rebate</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Peak</td>
        <td>17:00 - 24:00</td>
        <td><strong>+25% Surcharge</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Maharashtra's solar hour rebate (09:00-17:00) is unique among Indian states.
    Data centers that can shift workloads to daytime hours can save up to 15% on energy charges during
    these periods.
  </div>

  <h2>Peak Hour Impact Analysis</h2>

  <p>
    The +25% surcharge during peak hours (17:00-24:00) significantly impacts data center operating costs.
    For a typical 100-rack facility consuming 180 MWh/month:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>40% peak consumption:</strong> Additional cost of ~₹3.6 lakhs/month</li>
    <li><strong>25% peak consumption:</strong> Additional cost of ~₹2.25 lakhs/month</li>
    <li><strong>Optimized (15% peak):</strong> Additional cost of ~₹1.35 lakhs/month</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Demand Charges Explained</h2>

  <p>
    Maharashtra charges ₹400/kVA/month based on the higher of:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Contracted demand (what you agreed to in your connection)</li>
    <li>Recorded maximum demand (highest 15-minute average in the billing period)</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="warning-box">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Exceeding contracted demand can trigger penalty charges. Ensure your
    contracted demand has adequate headroom for peak operations and UPS charging cycles.
  </div>

  <h2>Green Energy Benefits</h2>

  <p>
    Data centers in Maharashtra using 100% green energy (through open access or captive solar)
    receive additional benefits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>10% wheeling charge discount</li>
    <li>Exemption from cross-subsidy surcharge for RE</li>
    <li>Banking facility for solar power (limited)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>DG Power Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Typical diesel generator costs in Maharashtra range from ₹20-24/kWh, approximately 2.5-3x the
    grid rate. Key factors affecting DG costs:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Diesel price: Currently ~₹90/litre</li>
    <li>Generator efficiency: 3-4 units/litre for large sets</li>
    <li>Maintenance overhead: ₹0.50-1.00/unit</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Billing Best Practices</h2>

  <p>
    For colocation operators billing tenants in Maharashtra:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Meter at rack level:</strong> Install smart PDUs to capture per-tenant consumption by time slot</li>
    <li><strong>Separate DG billing:</strong> Track grid vs DG consumption separately for accurate pass-through</li>
    <li><strong>Include all components:</strong> Energy + Demand + FAC + Duty + GST for full cost recovery</li>
    <li><strong>ToD transparency:</strong> Show tenants their peak vs off-peak consumption split</li>
  </ol>
